# RISE Template

This repository contains files and resources that I use to customized formatting of RISE slides. 
[RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) is a Jupyter environment plug in, that allow you to instantly turn Jupyter Notebooks into a interactive slideshow.

## Customizations
I customized my RISE slides in the following ways:
* I altered global settings to not center on the middel axis and use fade transitions.
* I import Google Fonts : `Open Sans` and `Merriweather` and overwrite default settings.
* I made template slides for: title slide, two column slides (with images), full screen image slides, end slide.
